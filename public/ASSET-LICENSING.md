# Asset licensing (public/)

- Keep proof of rights (license receipts/screenshots) for every third-party asset placed in `public/`.
- Remove or replace files showing official insignia/plates/uniforms unless you have explicit permission.
- AI/illustrated replacements are preferred for sensitive/official imagery.
- Stripped EXIF does **not** grant rights; always verify the source license.
- Store attribution/notes per file (source URL, creator, license terms, date added) in this directory.

Current notes:
- `prosafetymatch-bg.webp`: EXIF removed; ensure source is cleared for commercial use.
- `brandweer.jpg`: removed; do not reintroduce unless you have clear commercial rights and have sanitized official markings/plates.
