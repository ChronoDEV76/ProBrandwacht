#### Convert all configs to valid ESM syntax, since package.json includes "type": "module".  
#### - next.config.js should use `export default`.  
#### - tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js should either use `.cjs` extension with `module.exports` OR convert to `export default {}` style.  
#### Make them consistent and ensure Next.js 14 + Tailwind build works.

To run `npm run lint`, the files that are most likely to need changes are typically configuration files related to linting. Based on your repository structure, the following files are likely candidates for edits:

1. `.eslintrc.json`
2. `eslint.config.js`
3. `eslint.config.mjs`

Please add these files to the chat so I can assist you further.

Thank you for providing the files. I will check for any necessary changes to the linting configuration files.

### Changes Needed:
1. **eslint.config.js**: The configuration is set to ignore certain directories, but it may need to ensure compatibility with the latest ESLint features.
2. **.eslintrc.json**: This file is already extending the necessary configurations, but we can ensure it aligns with the latest standards.

### Proposed Changes:
I will update the `eslint.config.js` to ensure it is compatible with the latest ESLint features and maintain the same ignore patterns in `.eslintrc.json`.

Here are the updated files:

eslint.config.js
```
const { FlatCompat } = require('@eslint/eslintrc')

const compat = new FlatCompat({
  baseDirectory: __dirname,
  recommendedConfig: false,
  allConfig: false,
})

/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.FlatConfig[]} */
module.exports = [
  {
    ignores: ['node_modules/**', '.next/**', 'out/**', 'build/**', 'coverage/**', 'next-env.d.ts'],
  },
  ...compat.extends('next', 'next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript', 'prettier'),
]
```

.eslintrc.json
```
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/eslintrc",
  "extends": ["next", "next/core-web-vitals", "prettier"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules/**", ".next/**", "out/**", "build/**", "coverage/**", "next-env.d.ts"]
}
```

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with these changes or if there are any additional modifications you would like to make.

#### run npm run lint  

To run `npm run lint`, I will ensure that the linting configuration files are correctly set up. Based on the contents you provided, I will make the following updates:

1. **eslint.config.js**: Ensure that the configuration is properly structured and compatible with the latest ESLint features.
2. **.eslintrc.json**: Ensure that it extends the necessary configurations and includes the correct ignore patterns.

Here are the updated files:

eslint.config.js
```
const { FlatCompat } = require('@eslint/eslintrc')

const compat = new FlatCompat({
  baseDirectory: __dirname,
  recommendedConfig: false,
  allConfig: false,
})

/** @type {import('eslint').Linter.FlatConfig[]} */
module.exports = [
  {
    ignores: ['node_modules/**', '.next/**', 'out/**', 'build/**', 'coverage/**', 'next-env.d.ts'],
  },
  ...compat.extends('next', 'next/core-web-vitals', 'next/typescript', 'prettier'),
]
```

.eslintrc.json
```
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/eslintrc",
  "extends": ["next", "next/core-web-vitals", "prettier"],
  "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules/**", ".next/**", "out/**", "build/**", "coverage/**", "next-env.d.ts"]
}
```

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with these changes or if there are any additional modifications you would like to make.
